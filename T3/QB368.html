                    Australia's veteran off-spinner Nathan Lyon said a few of his team members were surprised over the reaction of members
                    of the Indian team over avoiding the follow-on on Day Four of the third Test at Gabba. At the Gabba, the last wicket
                    partnership between Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep helped India avoid the follow-on and averted a potential innings
                    defeat. As soon as Akash got a thick outside edge over gully for four off Pat Cummins, it led to jubilant reactions and
                    high-fives amongst captain Rohit Sharma, head coach Gautam Gambhir and talismanic batter Virat Kohli.
                    
                    “There's a few of us who spoke about (how we're) surprised about their reaction. We have played well and driven the game
                    to where we are. Frustrating but we are still sitting in the changing room 185 in front. I still feel if we bat well, we
                    can push for an Australian win.”</p>
